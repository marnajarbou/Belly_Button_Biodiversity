# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
I'll be using Plotly.js to build an interactive dashboard for researching data on the biodiversity of belly buttons. The dashboard can then be set up on a cloud server.

## Overview
Roza needed to finish the dashboard that was only partially built. She needed to see the microbiological data for each volunteer after completing a panel to collect their demographic information. Her subjects were specifically asked to be able to name the top 10 bacterial species found in their belly buttons. So that Roza's volunteers can determine whether a species is present in their navel if Improbable Beef nominates it as a contender to produce synthetic beef.
